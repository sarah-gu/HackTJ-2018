QuizMe Amazon Echo Plus Skill that quizzes user's on facts from the Driver's License Civic Test. 
Users prompt the programmed Amazon Echo by saying the phrase "Quiz Me", and Alexa launches into asking the user questions from Driver's License tests. The quiz is in a multiple choice format, and Alexa will inform the user of the right answer when the user answers incorrectly. 
This program was inspired by myself and my team member's want for a quizzing program that could help us study for our own driver's license tests.
